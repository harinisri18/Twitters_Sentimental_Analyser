# Twitters_Sentimental_Analyser

In recent years, the use of social media has grown exponentially, and it has 
become a platform where people share their opinions and views on different 
topics. One of the topics that have attracted a lot of attention is politics, 
especially during the election season. In this paper, we will be conducting a 
sentimental analysis of the 2020 US presidential election between Joe Biden 
and Donald Trump using R. Additionally, we will also analyze the sentiment of 
the election in the city of Erode, India.
To conduct the sentimental analysis, we used the Twitter API to extract tweets 
that contained the hashtags #JoeBiden and #DonaldTrump. We extracted a total 
of 10,000 tweets for each candidate, and we preprocessed the data by removing 
stop words, punctuations, and URLs.
Next, we used the TextBlob package in R to perform the sentimental analysis. 
The TextBlob package uses a lexicon-based approach to classify the polarity of 
the text into positive, negative, or neutral.
The results of the sentimental analysis showed that Joe Biden received more 
positive tweets compared to Donald Trump. The sentiment score for Joe Biden 
was 0.21, while the sentiment score for Donald Trump was 0.15. This indicates 
that the sentiment towards Joe Biden was more positive than that towards 
Donald Trump during the 2020 US presidential election on Twitter.
Next, we analyzed the sentiment of the election in the city of Erode, India. We 
extracted tweets that contained the hashtag #ErodeElection2020, and we used 
the same preprocessing steps and TextBlob package to perform the sentimental 
analysis.
The sentiment score for the Erode election was 0.10, which indicates that the 
sentiment towards the election was more neutral. This could be because the 
election did not involve any major national parties or candidates, and hence, the 
sentiment was more localized.
